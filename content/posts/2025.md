# 2025: The year of the AI agent.

2025 has proved to be the year AI agents went mainstream—moving from experimental side projects to core business infrastructure. With leaps in reasoning, real-time data access, and multi-step automation, agents now run entire workflows on their own: qualifying leads, drafting campaigns, managing operations, and coordinating across systems without human push. The competitive edge is shifting fast—from who has the biggest team to who has the smartest automated workforce. This year, innovation isn’t just about AI models; it’s about the agents that think, act, and deliver value independently.

A standout example comes from a US software company worth over $6 billion that has quietly rebuilt its operations around AI agents. They automate everything from customer support to full-cycle engineering, but the software development pipeline is where the change is most dramatic. PMs write a spec and hand it to an AI architect-agent, which rewrites and adjusts it based on the current system. From there, specialized agents code, test, deploy, and release the feature end to end. Updates and errors stream into Slack automatically, where another agent attempts fixes on the spot. Humans only step in when there’s truly no way forward. The result? A much leaner team with far more capacity—able to ship more projects, faster, and compete at a scale that would’ve been unthinkable a few years ago.

This shift signals a deeper transformation in how businesses will run. As agents get smarter, companies will reorganize around workflows where machines do most of the execution and humans handle judgment, strategy, and edge cases. Costs drop, product cycles shrink, and team size stops being the bottleneck. Early adopters will break away from the pack—not just in efficiency but in how quickly they can experiment, personalize, and seize new opportunities. The winners won’t have the biggest teams; they’ll have the best-designed human–AI systems.

But with all this progress comes a real risk: a potential bubble burst among US foundational model companies. Many are burning through billions while margins thin and differentiation fades. If investment cools, 2026 could bring consolidations, shutdowns, and a sharp reset across the sector. It may slow frontier model development, but it could also force a healthier pivot toward efficiency, specialization, and real-world value. Those who survive will combine ambition with financial discipline, and the industry could emerge stronger and more grounded.

And even with that turbulence ahead, the future still looks bright. A more focused, practical wave of AI innovation is coming—smaller, faster, more personal systems that completely integrate into everyday work. AI’s value will shift from hype to habit, quietly powering tools, agents, and workflows that make business radically more efficient. If 2025 was the year AI agents proved themselves, the years ahead will be when they truly transform everything.

Eager to see what 2026 brings.
