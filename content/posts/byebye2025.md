2025 was one of those years that quietly redraws the map of your life.

I got the chance to work with a **$6B company on AI and AI agents**, and I don’t say *life-changing* lightly. It reshaped how I think about scale, systems, and what’s possible when ambition meets real execution. That experience alone made the year memorable, but it was only part of the story.

This year also marked the beginning of **TJOC (The Joseph Olaoye Company)** — [https://tjoc.dev](https://tjoc.dev). It’s still early, and while there aren’t many polished products to show just yet, the foundations are firmly in place. Libraries like:

- [`@tjoc/analytics`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tjoc/analytics)  
- [`@tjoc/auth`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tjoc/auth)

represent the quiet, unglamorous work that future systems are built on. 2025 was about pouring concrete. It gets better in 2026.

Not everything went to plan. I ran into a few setbacks and lost a couple of opportunities I had big plans for. That part hurt. But progress is never a straight line — you take the wins, you learn from the losses, and you keep moving forward with sharper clarity.

On the upside, I was also opportuned to join **BMONI**, an experience that has already proven impactful. It’s one of those decisions that doesn’t make noise immediately but compounds over time. We do a lot more there in 2026.

Looking ahead, 2026 feels bold already. I’m hoping to finally build the two products that have been top of mind for a while now:

1. A software development shop largely run by AI agents.  
2. A community tool built *by* that first product.

A product creating another product — very meta, very on brand.

Here’s to the lessons of 2025, the foundations laid, and doing even more meaningful (and slightly unhinged) things in 2026.  
Cheers 🥂
