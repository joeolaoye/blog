# AGENTS.md — Giving Coding Agents What They Need for Success

In the age of AI-assisted coding, we often focus on the agents themselves — how smart they are, how many APIs they know, how fast they generate code. But there’s often a missing piece: **context, conventions, and explicit instructions** for those agents. That’s where **AGENTS.md** comes in.

## What Is AGENTS.md?

[AGENTS.md](https://agents.md/) is an open format—a simple Markdown file you place in the root of your repository—that gives coding agents a predictable place to find instructions tailored for them. It complements `README.md`, which is mostly human-facing, by holding guidelines and details that help AI agents work effectively. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

Examples of what it might contain:

- Build and test commands :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- Code style or formatting rules :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- PR or commit message conventions :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- Deployment or security considerations :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

## Why It Matters

Here’s what makes AGENTS.md valuable to teams building software today:

1. **Clarity for agents.** Without AGENTS.md, agents may run arbitrary defaults, guess at commands, or use wrong assumptions. Explicit instructions reduce mistakes and friction.  

2. **Cleaner human docs.** If you pack everything into README.md, that file becomes long, confusing, and cluttered. AGENTS.md lets you separate human-facing docs from agent-facing instructions. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  

3. **Ecosystem compatibility.** Many AI coding agents support AGENTS.md already — ranging from OpenAI’s Codex to numerous tools in the community. One file can serve many tools. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  

4. **Consistency in large or monorepo projects.** You can use nested AGENTS.md files for sub-projects, so each part of your codebase has context-sensitive instructions. Agents pick up the nearest AGENTS.md to the file they’re working on. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

## How to Use AGENTS.md Effectively

To get the most out of AGENTS.md, consider adopting these practices:

- **Add it early.** Don’t wait until agents are causing issues. Include AGENTS.md when you set up your repo.  
- **Be specific, but concise.** List commands, conventions, and tips clearly. For example, “run `npm test` before merging” is better than vague “check tests.”  

- **Separate concerns.** Use different sections like “Build & Test Commands,” “Code Style,” “PR Guidelines,” “Security / Deployment,” etc.  

- **Keep it up to date.** As your codebase evolves, so should your AGENTS.md. If builds/tests change, update the file.  

- **Use nested AGENTS.md in large repos.** If you have a monorepo with frontend, backend, infra, etc., drop AGENTS.md in each major subfolder so agents in each context get precise instructions.

## Final Thoughts

AGENTS.md is a small addition with outsized benefits.  

If you work with AI coding agents — whether internally or via third-party tools — giving them clear, context-rich guidance reduces friction, increases trust, and improves code quality.  

The code still matters — but tools matter too. AGENTS.md helps bridge that gap between your project’s human vision and what agents need to work well.
