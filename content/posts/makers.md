# The Maker’s Paradox: Balancing Building and Leading in Software Engineering  

One of the biggest challenges for new software engineering leaders isn’t technical at all — it’s deciding **where to spend their time**.  

On one hand, you’re still a *maker* — someone who loves building software, solving problems in code, and architecting systems. On the other, you’re now a *leader* — responsible for guiding teams, aligning priorities, and creating the conditions for others to do their best work.  

This is the **Maker’s Paradox**: the tension between wanting to build the software yourself and needing to lead the people who are building it.

## Why It’s So Hard  
1. **Identity shift** – Many leaders were promoted because they were strong engineers. Letting go of being “the one who fixes it” can feel like losing part of your identity.  
2. **Control vs. trust** – Writing code gives you direct control. Leading a team requires trusting others with decisions you might once have made.  
3. **Short-term vs. long-term value** – Jumping into code feels productive in the moment. But investing in people, processes, and culture pays off in the long run.

## Common Pitfalls for New Leaders  
- Spending too much time on coding at the expense of team guidance.  
- Micromanaging technical details instead of empowering tech leads.  
- Neglecting communication with stakeholders because “the code needs shipping.”

## How to Tackle the Maker’s Paradox  

### 1. Redefine your “maker work.”  
Your output isn’t just code anymore. It’s clarity, alignment, and decisions that unblock others. Start viewing those as deliverables, just as important as pull requests.  

### 2. Pick your coding battles.  
Don’t vanish from the codebase, but be deliberate. Take on tasks that won’t bottleneck the team — spikes, prototypes, or low-risk contributions.  

### 3. Invest in your leaders.  
If you have senior engineers or tech leads, make them your leverage. Support their growth so they can handle technical depth while you focus on strategic direction.  

### 4. Timebox your roles.  
Some leaders use a split schedule — mornings for deep technical focus, afternoons for leadership work. Protect your calendar so one role doesn’t swallow the other.  

### 5. Measure success differently.  
Early in your career, success was shipping features. As a leader, success is your *team shipping features without you*.

## Final Thought  
The Maker’s Paradox never fully disappears — even experienced leaders feel the pull between building and leading. The key is to **shift your mindset**: leadership is a different kind of making. You’re not just making code; you’re making *teams, culture, and systems* that scale far beyond your individual output.  

New leaders who embrace that shift not only grow themselves — they unlock the full potential of their teams.
